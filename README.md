This is a functional Todo List application built with [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/), Rust, and vanilla JavaScript. It was generated and iteratively improved using the **Gemini CLI agent** to demonstrate the capabilities of AI-assisted software development.


## Features

*   **Core Functionality:** Add, edit, toggle completion, and delete tasks.
*   **Data Persistence:** Uses **SQLite** (`rusqlite`) to save tasks locally to a `todos.db` file.
*   **Timestamps & Deadlines:** automatically tracks creation time and supports optional, editable deadlines for every task.
*   **Smart Sorting:** 
    *   **Deadline:** Sort by earliest deadline first.
    *   **Created:** Sort by newest task first.
    *   *Note: Pending tasks are always prioritized over completed ones.*
*   **Theming:** Built-in Light and Dark mode toggle that persists across sessions.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Configured for **Windows** (Desktop) and **Android** (Mobile) development.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Rust:** Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable).
2.  **System Dependencies:**
    *   **Windows:** Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools.
    *   **Android:** Android Studio (SDK, NDK, Command-line tools) is required for mobile targets.

## Getting Started

### Desktop (Windows)

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    This command downloads dependencies, compiles the Rust backend, and launches the application window.

### Android

1.  Ensure your Android development environment is correctly set up (Environment variables `ANDROID_HOME`, `NDK_HOME`).
2.  Initialize the Android project (only needed once):
    ```bash
    cargo tauri android init
    ```
3.  Run on an emulator or connected device:
    ```bash
    cargo tauri android dev
    ```

## Development Tools

To maintain code quality and adhere to Rust standards, use the following built-in tools:

*   **Type Checking:**
    ```bash
    cargo check
    ```
    Quickly checks your code for compilation errors and type mismatches without building the executable. It is significantly faster than `cargo build`.

*   **Linting (Clippy):**
    ```bash
    cargo clippy
    ```
    The official Rust linter. It goes beyond basic errors to catch common mistakes, non-idiomatic patterns, and potential performance issues.

*   **Formatting:**
    ```bash
    cargo fmt
    ```
    Automatically formats your code according to the standard Rust style guide using `rustfmt`.

*   **Unit Testing:**
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```
    Runs all unit tests defined in the project. Tests are written directly in Rust code to ensure the backend logic functions correctly.

*   **Security Audit:**
    ```bash
    cargo audit
    ```
    Scans your project's dependencies (`Cargo.lock`) for known security vulnerabilities against the RustSec Advisory Database. Install it via `cargo install cargo-audit`.

*   **Pre-commit Hooks (Automated):**
    This project uses **cargo-husky** to automatically manage Git hooks.
    
    **Setup:**
    Simply run `cargo test` or `cargo build` once. The hooks will be automatically installed into `.git/hooks/`.
    
    Now, every time you commit, the following will run automatically:
    *   `cargo fmt` (Check formatting)
    *   `cargo clippy` (Check for linting errors)
    *   `cargo test` (Run unit tests)

## Project Structure

*   **`src/main.rs`**: The Rust backend. It handles the SQLite database connection, defines the data structure (`Todo` struct), and exposes commands (`add_todo`, `get_todos`, etc.) to the frontend.
*   **`dist/index.html`**: The Frontend. A single-file UI using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript that communicates with the backend via Tauri's IPC.
*   **`tauri.conf.json`**: Main configuration file for the Tauri application (window settings, permissions, bundle config).
*   **`Cargo.toml`**: Rust package manifest, listing dependencies like `rusqlite`, `chrono`, and `serde`.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Variables for theming), Vanilla JavaScript.
*   **Backend:** Rust, Tauri v2.
*   **Database:** SQLite (via `rusqlite` bundled).
*   **Date Handling:** `chrono`.
